== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I find my channel ID or username? =


If you can see your channel at all, the URL is in the browser address bar.
If you can find your channel in YouTube search, then search it and copy its link address, it should contain an ID. for instance: UCF0pVplsI8R5kcAqgtoRqoA ( youtube dot com /channel/UCF0pVplsI8R5kcAqgtoRqoA ) as a channel ID, and mullenweg ( youtube dot com /user/mullenweg ) as a username.
